# krul-site-Hamoos
In this project I implemented a plugin completely reworked by me, which sends invoices to mail to customers, saves them in the admin in PDF format, and you can also save the invoice and receipt in PDF format. Also, the plugin in the admin panel shows all the information about the user's orders. Also partially reworked the design and functionality of the site.
